These are the most common coordinate frame operations.

Main definitions:

**Earth-Centered Inertial Frame** (ECI) has the origin at the center of mass of
the Earth. The X-axis points towards the vernal equinox in the equatorial
plane. The Z-axis is along the rotation axis of the Earth. The y-axis completes
with a right-hand system. Some literature names it **i-frame**.

**Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed Frame** (ECEF) has its origin and z-axis aligned
to the ECI frame, but rotates along with the Earth. Therefore is Earth-Fixed.
Some literature names it **e-frame**.

**Local-Level Frame** (LLF) is the local navigation frame, whose origin
coincides with the sensor frame. Some literature names it **l-frame**.

**Body Frame** matches the frame of the platform the sensors are mounted on.
The origin coincides with the center of gravity of the platform. The Y-axis
points forward of the moving platform, while the Z-axis points upwards. The
X-axis completes the right-hand system pointing in traverse direction. Some
literature names it **b-frame**.

**East-North-Up Frame** (ENU) is an LLF with the X-axis pointing East, Y-axis
pointing to the true North, and the Z-axis completes a right-hand system
pointing up (away from Earth.)

**North-East-Down Frame** (NED) is an LLF with the X-axis pointing to the true
North, Y-axis pointing East, and the Z-axis completing the right-hand system
pointing Down.

**Rectangular coordinates** in the ECEF represent position of a point with its
x, y, and z vector components aligned parallel to the corresponding e-frame
axes.

**Geodetic** (also ellipsoidal or curvilinear) **coordinates** in the ECEF are
defined for positioning elements on or near the Earth.

**Meridian** is the half of a creat circle on Earth's surface terminated by the
poles.

**Latitude** is the angle in the meridian plane from the equatorial plane to
the ellipsoidal normal at he point of interest.

**Longitude** is the angle in the equatorial plane from the prime meridian to
the projection of the point of interest onto the equatorial plane.

**Altitude** is the distance along the ellipsoidal normal between the surface
of the ellipsoid and the point of interest.
